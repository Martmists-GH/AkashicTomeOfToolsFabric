# AkashicTome
The book of books. (and tools)

Derivative of VazkiiMods:AkashicTome completely rewritten for 1.17 Fabric by vlad2305m

Now you can use your tome as a morph-o-tool or any other multitool or multiarmour, because it is impossible to destroy it (unless you make it a water bucket and put it into a dispenser). (Or like a cool unconvenient bundle without capacity limit)

This mod requires [ClothConfigApi](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).
